Rock or Mine Detection Using Logistic Regression
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify objects as either rocks or mines using logistic regression. The objective is to accurately predict the type of object based on given features in the dataset.

Project Overview
The dataset used in this project lacks header names, and therefore requires careful preprocessing to ensure the data is suitable for modeling. The steps taken in this project include:

Importing Libraries: All necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, preprocessing, and model building were imported.

Loading the Dataset: The dataset was loaded without headers and prepared for analysis.

Data Analysis: Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.

Label Encoding: The target labels were encoded into numerical values to facilitate the application of logistic regression.

Data Splitting: The dataset was split into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%) to train and evaluate the model, respectively.

Model Training: A logistic regression model was trained on the training data to distinguish between rocks and mines.

Model Evaluation: The model achieved an accuracy of over 85% on the test set, indicating strong predictive performance.
